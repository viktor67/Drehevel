Drehevel, meaning build, is a simple tool to help automate distribution of CryENGINE3 games.

# What it does

* Removes unnecessary files like backups and editor data
* Packages the game into a convenient .zip archive
* Saves build settings to .xml for reuse
* Processes the stock engine build in 12 seconds on an i7 2600k

# Credits

* DotNetZip for the archival library.
